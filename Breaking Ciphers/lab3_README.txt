This project fascinated me so much that it sparked an ongoing interest in ciphers and cryptography in relation to computer science!

Language: Haskell

Objective: In this lab, we deciphered arbitrary ROT-n cipher, and also cracked a Vigenere Cipher of known key length. 

vindecoden.hs: This was the file that broke the Vigenere Cipher. The critical method in this code was “vdecode”, which performed the actual cracking of the cipher. It works exactly as intended. 

Note: This relies on test files provided to us by instructors (“c2.txt”), which no longer exist in this repository.
