Language: Haskell

Objective: This lab involved working with creating representations of polynomials in Haskell and using them to implement the Fast Fourier Transform.

lab1.hs: The part of this file that performs the actual FFT manipulation is the method fft. At the end of the file, polyMultFFT uses the Fast Fourier Transform to quickly multiply polynomials.
